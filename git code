---

Let me know if you’d like to automate this with a script or need help creating the remote GitHub repo!



Here is the Git command-line guide to complete all 10 tasks under "Analyzing Contribution History" for your project milestone:


---

Analyzing Contribution History – Git Commands


---

1. View the entire commit history:

git log --oneline --graph --all


---

2. Filter log by a specific contributor (e.g., Alice):

git log --author="Alice" --oneline


---

3. Generate a list of all authors and their contributions:

git shortlog -s -n

-s = show number of commits

-n = sort by number of commits (descending)



---

4. Check the most recent commit by a contributor (e.g., Bob):

git log --author="Bob" -1


---

5. Identify files modified in a particular commit:

git show --name-only <commit-hash>

Replace <commit-hash> with the actual commit ID.


---

6. Summary: Who worked on which files

Run this to create a rough summary (not perfect, but helpful):

git log --pretty=format:"%an" --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

Or for file-level author data:

git log --pretty=format:"%an" --name-only | awk 'NF' | sort | uniq -c


---

7. Compare two branches (main vs development) by contributor:

git log main..development --author="Alice" --oneline

To see all differences between main and development:

git diff main..development


---

8. Track all changes made to a file (e.g., task.js):

git log --follow -- task.js

To include the content of changes:

git log -p --follow task.js


---

9. Export the full commit history to a text file:

git log > commit-history.txt


---

10. Why Contribution History Helps Team Management:

Contribution analysis:

Identifies active contributors and their responsibilities.

Tracks who introduced what, making debugging and collaboration easier.

Encourages accountability and transparency.

Helps managers understand workload distribution and performance.

Aids in code reviews by letting you tag the right person for context.

Let me know if you want to turn this into a PDF report or visualize the contributions graphically!



Here is the complete Git command-line code for staging selected changes and managing commits effectively:


---

Staging Selected Changes – Step-by-Step Git Commands


---

1. Modify three files

(Manually make changes in the following files using your editor of choice:)

header.html

footer.html

script.js



---

2. View modified files

git status

This will show the three modified files under "Changes not staged for commit".


---

3. Stage only header.html

git add header.html


---

4. View the staged changes

git diff --staged

This shows exactly what is about to be committed from header.html.


---

5. Commit staged changes

git commit -m "Updated header structure."


---

6. Stage footer.html only

git add footer.html

(Leave script.js unchanged)


---

7. Commit footer.html

git commit -m "Refined footer design."


---

8. Verify that script.js remains unstaged

git status

script.js should still show as modified but not staged.


---

9. Push all committed changes to remote

git push origin main


---

10. Test selective commits (clone in new folder)

cd ..
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BudgetPlanner.git BudgetPlanner_Test
cd BudgetPlanner_Test

Then check commit log and file contents:

git log --oneline


---

Let me know if you’d like to automate this in a shell script or add more selective staging techniques like git add -p (for staging parts of a file).



Here’s the full set of Git command-line instructions for performing branch comparisons for QA based on your scenario:


---

Branch Comparisons for QA – Git Commands


---

1. Switch to the main branch:

git checkout main


---

2. Compare main with feature-testing:

git diff main..feature-testing

This shows line-by-line differences between the two branches.


---

3. Identify files modified in feature-testing:

git diff --name-only main..feature-testing

Expected output:

test.js
config.js


---

4. Test the modified files (test.js and config.js)

Manually test the changes in your development environment or using automated scripts.


---

5. Create and switch to qa-testing branch, then merge:

git checkout -b qa-testing
git merge feature-testing


---

6. Stage and commit changes after QA feedback:

(After editing/testing based on QA feedback)

git add .
git commit -m "QA feedback applied: adjustments to test.js and config.js"


---

7. Push qa-testing to remote:

git push -u origin qa-testing


---

8. Test qa-testing locally to confirm QA requirements:

Manually run test suites or validate functionality in your dev environment.


---

9. Document differences (save diff output):

git diff main..feature-testing > branch-differences.txt

You now have a text file with the detailed differences for QA documentation.


---

10. How git diff supports code quality:

Helps identify unexpected or unreviewed changes

Ensures feature branches only include intended modifications

Essential for code reviews, testing, and QA sign-off

Enables targeted testing by showing exactly what needs verification

Reduces bugs and regressions by highlighting conflicts early



---

Let me know if you'd like to turn this into a shell script for repeated use or export comparison results into a formatted report!



Here's a step-by-step Git + GitHub workflow to manage and collaborate on a pull request for the feature-comments branch:


---

Collaborating on Pull Requests – Git & GitHub Commands


---

1. Create a branch named feature-comments:

git checkout -b feature-comments


---

2. Modify comments.js

Make your feature changes in comments.js using your preferred code editor.


---

3. Stage and commit changes with issue reference:

git add comments.js
git commit -m "Added new comment feature (#45)"


---

4. Push feature-comments to the remote repository:

git push -u origin feature-comments


---

5. Create a Pull Request (PR):

Go to your GitHub repo in the browser:

GitHub will prompt you to “Compare & pull request”

Title: Feature: Add comment system

Description: Mention Closes #45 to link and auto-close the issue

Base: main

Compare: feature-comments



---

6. Assign the PR to a teammate:

Use the "Reviewers" and "Assignees" section in GitHub

Assign a teammate to review the PR



---

7. Address review feedback:

Make any requested changes locally, then:

git add .
git commit -m "Refactored comment feature based on feedback"
git push

GitHub will automatically update the PR with your new commits.


---

8. Approve and merge the PR (once approved):

Click Merge pull request in GitHub

Optionally delete the feature-comments branch after merging



---

9. Verify merged changes in main:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

Check that your changes from comments.js exist in the main branch.


---

10. Close Issue #45 (if not auto-closed):

If the PR message didn't include Closes #45, close the issue manually in GitHub:

Go to the Issues tab

Locate Issue #45

Click Close issue



---

Let me know if you want a GitHub Actions workflow added for automatic testing, or a markdown template for pull request descriptions!




Here’s a complete Git command guide for safely setting up and working with backup branches before applying experimental changes:


---

Setting Up Backup Branches – Git Commands


---

1. Switch to the main branch:

git checkout main


---

2. Create a backup branch named backup-main:

git checkout -b backup-main


---

3. Push the backup to the remote repository:

git push -u origin backup-main


---

4. Switch back to main to begin testing:

git checkout main


---

5. Modify index.js with experimental changes

Open index.js in your editor and make changes.


---

6. Stage and commit the experimental changes:

git add index.js
git commit -m "Experimental changes in index.js for testing"


---

7. Create a restore branch and merge backup into it:

git checkout -b restore-main
git merge backup-main


---

8. Push the restore-main branch to the cloud:

git push -u origin restore-main


---

9. Test restore-main locally:

git checkout restore-main
# Now check if the files match the original state before the experimental changes

You can also compare with main to confirm:

git diff main..restore-main


---

10. Why backup branches matter in development:

Safety Net: Avoids losing stable code when trying risky updates

Isolation: Keeps experiments separate from working versions

Recovery: Quickly revert to known-good state if tests fail

Team Trust: Ensures collaborative work isn’t accidentally overwritten

Audit Trail: Preserves history of important checkpoints



---

Let me know if you want to automate backup creation with a script or set up Git hooks to remind you to back up before each major change!
